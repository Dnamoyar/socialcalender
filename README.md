# socialcalender
This project provides an example list of social events to which the user has been invited. The events in the example conflict in terms of timing so the user can only choose one of the radio button options at a time. Three different functions are invoked depending on which of the 3 choices the user selects. A global array variable exists to record each radio button value the user selects, and this array is outputed each time a new radio button is selected. The project uses the following JavaScript items: Array, setTimeout, custom functions, windows.alert, immediately invoked function expression, array.push method. Bootstrap is used for basic styling, and the index.css file is therefore redundant.
